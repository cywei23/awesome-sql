# Problem:
```
For each user_id, find the difference between the last action and the second last action. Action
here is defined as visiting a page. If the user has just one action, you can either remove her from
the final results or keep that user_id and have NULL as time difference between the two actions.
The table below shows for each user all the pages she visited and the corresponding
timestamp.
```
| user id   | page          | unix_timestamp  |
| --------- |:-------------:| ---------------:|
| 1         | home page     |      1451640067 |
| 2         | search        |      1451647141 |
| 3         | home page     |      1451653638 |

# Solution:

```sql
SELECT user_id,
  unix_timestamp - previous_time AS delta
  FROM
  (SELECT user_id,
    unix_timestamp,
    LAG(unix_timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY
    unix_timestamp) AS previous_time,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY
    unix_timestamp DESC) AS order_desc
    FROM query_one
  ) tmp
  WHERE order_desc = 1
  ORDER BY user_id
  LIMIT 5;
```

#### Result:
| user id | delta |
| ------- |:-----:|
|     1   |       |
|     2   |   2   |
|     3   |   4   |
